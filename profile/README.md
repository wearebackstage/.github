# Backstage

We build event tech and brand activations for live-event and experiential marketing agencies, allowing them to pitch to their brands with confidence.

This means we do a lot and lots of custom web development with things like Django, React.js, Vue.js, Ember.js among many other technologies. If you're interested in this stuff, [reach out and say hello](https://wearebackstage.com/contact-us/) - we're always looking to connect with great developers.
