# Backstage Experiential

We build event tech and brand activations for live-event and experiential marketing agencies, allowing them to pitch to their brands with confidence.

This means we do a lot and lots of custom web development with things like Django, React.js, Vue.js, Ember.js among many other technologies. If you're interested in this stuff, reach out and say hello - we're always looking to connect with great developers.
